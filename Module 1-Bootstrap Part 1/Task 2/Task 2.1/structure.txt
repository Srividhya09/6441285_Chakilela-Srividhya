1. CSS Folder
Purpose:
This folder contains all the styles that define how our web page looks (layout, colors, spacing, typography, etc.).

bootstrap.css:

This is the full version with readable formatting and comments.

Good for learning and debugging.

bootstrap.min.css:

Minified version (all spaces and comments removed).

Smaller in size, used for production websites to improve loading speed.

2. JS Folder
Purpose:
This contains JavaScript files that power Bootstrap's interactive components like modals, dropdowns, tooltips, carousels, etc.

bootstrap.bundle.js:

Contains Bootstrap’s JavaScript and Popper.js (required for tooltips, dropdowns, etc.).

Unminified, useful for understanding or debugging.

bootstrap.bundle.min.js:

Minified version, best for real use on websites.

If you only include bootstrap.js without the "bundle", you must separately include popper.js — that’s why the bundle version is preferred.

3. Icons Folder (Optional)
Purpose:
If downloaded, this folder contains the Bootstrap Icons – a set of scalable vector icons.

Includes files like:

bootstrap-icons.css

font files (.woff2, .ttf, etc.)

These icons are similar to Font Awesome and can be easily used in web pages.
